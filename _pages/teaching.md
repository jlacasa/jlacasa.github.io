- An Introduction to Applied Statistics in R - 2021, 2022.  
  This mini-course strated on demand in 2021, to help a group of curious undergraduate students and visiting scholar in our lab. They approached me and told me they wanted to learn R and statistics! So we met weekly to introduce R programming and refresh+advance concepts in statistics.
