Welcome to my website!
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Kansas State University. 
Overall, my research lies at the intersection between statistics and agriculture. I work to improve the quantitative methods applied by agricultural researchers. 
On this website, you will find news about my research and teaching activities.
