I was born and raised in Buenos Aires (Argentina) but was lucky enough to spend most of my summers and winters on my family's farm. 
This led me to study Agronomy at the Universidad of Buenos Aires, where I worked as a research and teaching assistant in Applied Biochemistry and Crop Physiology. 
During my study abroad program at K-State, I continued exploring my passion for research in crop physiology and applied statistics. 
By this time, I also became a huge supporter of Bayesian Statistics.  

After finishing my B.S. in Agronomy, I moved to the US to work on my M.Sc. in Statistics (Math option) and Ph.D. in Agronomy at K-State. 
Most of my research contributions so far are methodological development and translational statistics to solve problems in crop physiology and plant breeding. 
In addition, I am helping the next generation of plant scientists to get started with R programming and statistics.  

My research interests are Applied Statistics in Agronomy and Crop Physiology.  

You can find my complete CV [here](/Lacasa_July23.pdf).

**Hobbies**  
I love playing volleyball and soccer, climbing, hiking, and spending time outdoors with family and friends (see picture below).
