I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
I studied Agronomy at the Universidad of Buenos Aires, where I worked as a student research intern and teaching assistant in Applied Biochemistry and Crop Physiology. 
During my study abroad program at Kansas State University (K-State), I continued exploring my passion for research in crop physiology and applied statistics. 
By this time, I also became a huge supporter of Bayesian Statistics.  

After finishing my B.S. in Agronomy, I moved to the US to work on my M.Sc. in Mathematical Statistics and Ph.D. in Agronomy at K-State. 
Most of my contributions so far are applications of advanced statistical methods to solve problems in crop physiology and plant breeding. 
In addition, I am helping the next generation of plant scientists to get started learning R programming and statistics.  

My research interests are Applied Statistics in Agronomy and Crop Physiology.

**Hobbies**  
I love playing sports, like volleyball, climbing, hiking, and soccer.
